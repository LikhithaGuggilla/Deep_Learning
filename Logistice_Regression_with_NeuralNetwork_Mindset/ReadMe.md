## Here's what can be learnt from this section:
* Build the general architecture of a learning algorithm(Logistic Regression with Neural Network Mindset), including initializing parameters, calculating the cost function(Forward Propagation) and its gradient(Backward Propagation), and using an optimization algorithm (gradient descent).
* Integrate the components into a main model function for logistic regression.
* Evaluate the model's performance on a dataset and analyze the results.
* Test the model with new images to see its practical application.
